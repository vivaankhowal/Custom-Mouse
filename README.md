# Custom-Mouse
I need a custom mouse to game, CAD and just general use, so why not build one instead of buying one?

I followed the Squeak tutorial in Blueprint for this project. I decided to put my logo on the back for a personal touch.

CAD: [View CAD on Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fc07b257dd5340b48a297c2a/w/90fc19b2e20aa95f51719d28/e/4a16224864e4af95dcc56fb1?renderMode=0&uiState=697807c9134c99938662ce0d)

This was good practice for me to work with designing 3D printed parts with electronic parts. I have experience doing it before, but I always wanted a mouse for general use so it was nice to get some practice in.
